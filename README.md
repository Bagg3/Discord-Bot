# Discord Bot with TypeScript/JavaScript

Welcome to my first Discord Bot project, crafted in TypeScript/JavaScript. The quality of the code mirrors my learning journey in these languages.

## Project Overview

This Discord Bot utilizes the Discord.js Node module, the Discord API, and MongoDB as a database. 
Its primary function is to respond to inside jokes within a friend group. The bot achieves this by posting images, GIFs, and, for added flair, joining voice calls and playing sound clips.
While also tracking the users who utilize the bot the most and keeping a record of the most frequently used bot commands. 

## Technologies Used 

- Discord.js: [Documentation](https://discord.js.org/)
- Discord API
- MongoDB
